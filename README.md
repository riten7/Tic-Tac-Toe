## Project Description
A simple Tic Tac Toe game on React Hooks! <br />

It works the following way: 
1. The first player to go places an X anywhere on the board by clicking a square, 
2. The next player will be able to place an O, 
3. It continues alternating like this every turn. 

If there is a winner, a message is displayed at the top with 3 X's or O's in a row.
Finally, the reset function resets the entire board. 

### `How to run`

1. run npm install / yarn install (install all the required dependencies for the application)
2. npm start / yarn start (run the application in the browser).

### `Run test cases`

1. yarn test (test all the test files available in the application)
2. yarn test --coverage (generate test report with coverage details)

Note: Once you run the yarn test --coverage then the coverage folder will be created at the root where you can find index.html inside Icov-report. You can view the test coverage using index.html.
