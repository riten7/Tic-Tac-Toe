## Project Description
A simple Tic Tac Toe game on React Hooks! <br />

It works the following way: 
1. The first player to go places an X anywhere on the board by clicking a square, 
2. The next player will be able to place an O, 
3. It continues alternating like this every turn until a player has won or the game is drawn. 

If there is a winner, a message is displayed at the top saying Congratulation! X/O have won.
Finally, the reset function resets the entire board. You can reset the game at any time.

### `How to run`

1. run `npm install / yarn install` (installs all the dependencies for the application)
2. run `npm start / yarn start` (run the application in development mode).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. <br />

### `Run test cases`

1. run `yarn test` (run all the test files in the application)
2. run `yarn test --coverage` (run test coverage as well as generate test coverage report with details)

Note: Once you run the yarn test --coverage then the coverage folder will be created at the root where you can find index.html inside Icov-report. You can view the test coverage using index.html.
